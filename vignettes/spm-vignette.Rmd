## Overview

The R-package \texttt{spm} (\url{https://github.com/izhbannikov/spm}) is developed for modeling trajectories from longitudinal data  and it allows (1) data simulation and (2) estimating the process parameters using maximum likelihood estimation by optimizing parameters used in the model. Specifically, developed R-package spm allows (i) one-dimensional SPM; (ii) multiple dimensional SPM; (iii) data simulation for one- and multiple dimensions.

## Data description

Data represents a typical longitudinal data in form of two datasets: longitudinal dataset (follow-up studies), in which one record represents a single observation, and vital (survival) statistics, where one record represents all information about the subject. Longitudinal dataset cat contain a subject ID (identification number), status (event(1)/no event(0)), time and measurements across the variables. The \texttt{spm} can handle an infinite number of variables but in practice, 5-7 variables is enough.

```{r,results='hide',warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(spm)
# Reading longitude data:
longdat <- read.csv(system.file("data","longdat.csv",package="spm"))
# Prepare data for optimization:
vitstat <- read.csv(system.file("data","vitstat.csv",package="spm"))
```

Below there is an example of clinical data that can be used in \texttt{spm} and we will discuss the field later.
Longitudinal studies:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(longdat)
```
Vital statistics:
```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(vitstat)
```

#### Data fields description
##### Longitude studies
* ID - subject unique identificatin number.
* IndicatorDeath - 0/1, indicates death of a subject.
* Age - current age of subjects.
* AgeNext - next age of subject he will attend to the survey/exam.
* DBP, BMI - covariates, here "DBP" represents a diastolic blood pressure, "BMI" a body-mass index.

##### Survival statistics
* ID - subject's unique ID.
* IsDead - death indicator, 0 - alive, 1 - dead.
* LSmort - age at death of stopping observations.

## Discrete and Continuous cases

There are two main SPM types in the package: discrete model and continuous model. Discrete model assumes equal intervals between follow-up observations. The example of discrete dataset is given below.

```{r}
library(spm)
data <- simdata_discr(N=10, ystart=c(80), k=1)
head(data)
```
In this case there are equal intervals between t1 and t2 (Age and Age.next).

The opposite is continuous case, in which intervals between observations are not equal. The example of continuous case dataset is shown below:

```{r}
library(spm)
data <- simdata_cont(N=5,ystart = c(50))
head(data)
```



### Discrete case
In discrete case, we use the following assumptions:
$$ \bar{y}(t+1) = \bar{u} + \bar{R} \times \bar{y}(t) + \bar{\epsilon} $$ (1)
$$ \mu(t) = \mu_0(t) + \bar{b}(t) \times \bar{y}(t) + \bar{Q} \times \bar{y}(t)^2 $$ (2)

Where:
$$ \mu_0(t) = \mu_0 e^{\theta t} $$
$$ \bar{b}(t) = \bar{b} e^{\theta t} $$
$$ \bar{Q}(t) = \bar{Q} e^{\theta t} $$



## Continuous case

$$ \mu(u) = \mu_0(u) + (\bar{m}(u) - \bar{f}(u)^* \times \bar{Q}(u) \times (\bar{m}(u) - \bar{f}(u)) + Tr(\bar{Q}(u) \times \bar{\gamma}(u)) $$ (3)

$$ dm(t)/dt = \bar{a}(t) \times (\bar{m}(t) - \bar{f_1}(t)) - 2 \bar{\gamma}(t) \times \bar{Q}(t) \times (\bar{m}(t) - \bar{f}(t)) $$ (4)
$$ d\bar{\gamma}(t)/dt = \bar{a}(t) \times \bar{\gamma}(t) +  \bar{\gamma}(t) \times \bar{a}(t)^* + \bar{b}(t) \times \bar{b}(t)^* - 2 \bar{\gamma}{t} \times \bar{Q}(t) \times \bar{\gamma}(t) $$ (5)

## Coefficient conversion between continuous and discrete cases

$$ Q = Q $$
$$ \bar{a} = \bar{R} - diag(k) $$
$$ \bar{b} = \bar{\epsilon} $$
$$ \bar{f1} = -1 \times \bar{u} \times \bar{a^{-1}} $$
$$ \bar{f} = -0.5 \times \bar{b} \times \bar{Q^{-1}} $$
$$ mu_0 = mu_0 - \bar{f} \times \bar{Q} \times t(\bar{f}) $$
$$ \theta = \theta $$

## Case with time-dependent coefficients

In two previous cases, we assumed that coefficients is sort of time-dependant: we multiplied them on to $$e^{\theta t}$$. In general, this may not be the case. We extend this to a general case, i.e. (we consider one-dimensional case):

$$ \bar{a(t)} = par_1 t + par_2 $$ - linear function. 

The corresponding equations will be equivalent to one-dimensional continuous case described above.

## Simulation

We added one- and multi- dimensional simulation to be able to generate test data for hyphotesis testing. Data,  which can be simulated can be discrete (equal intervals between observations) and continuous (with arbitrary intervals).

## Discrete

The corresponding function is:

```simdata_discr(N=100, a=-0.05, f1=80, Q=2e-8, f=80, b=5, mu0=1e-5, theta=0.08, ystart=80, tstart=30, tend=105, dt=1, k=1)```

Here:

```N``` - Number of individuals

```a``` - A matrix of ```k```x```k```, which characterize the rate of the adaptive response

```f1``` - A particular state, which if a deviation from the normal (or optimal). This is a vector with length of ```k```

```Q``` - A matrix of ```k``` by ```k```, which is a non-negative-definite symmetric matrix

```f``` - A vector-function (with length ```k```) of the normal (or optimal) state

```b``` - A diffusion coefficient, ```k``` by ```k``` matrix

```mu0``` - mortality at start period of time (baseline hazard)

```theta``` - A displacement coefficient of the Gompertz function

```ystart``` - A vector with length equal to number of dimensions used, defines starting values of covariates

```tstart``` - A number that defines a start time (30 by default)

```tend``` - A number, defines a final time (105 by default)

```dt``` - A time interval between observations.

```k``` - number of dimensions (1 by default)


This function returns a table with simulated data, as shown in example below:

```{r}
library(spm)
data <- simdata_discr(N=10, ystart=c(75, 94), k=2)
head(data)
```

## Continuous

The correstonding function is:

```simdata_cont(N=100, a=-0.05, f1=80, Q=2e-07, f=80, b=5, mu0=2e-05, theta=0.08, ystart=80, tstart=30, tend=105, k=1)```

Here:

```N``` - Number of individuals

```a``` - A matrix of ```k```x```k```, which characterize the rate of the adaptive response

```f1``` - A particular state, which if a deviation from the normal (or optimal). This is a vector with length of ```k```

```Q``` - A matrix of ```k``` by ```k```, which is a non-negative-definite symmetric matrix

```f``` - A vector-function (with length ```k```) of the normal (or optimal) state

```b``` - A diffusion coefficient, ```k``` by ```k``` matrix

```mu0``` - mortality at start period of time (baseline hazard)

```theta``` - A displacement coefficient of the Gompertz function

```ystart``` - A vector with length equal to number of dimensions used, defines starting values of covariates

```tstart``` - A number that defines a start time (30 by default)

```tend``` - A number, defines a final time (105 by default)

```k``` - number of dimensions (1 by default)

This function returns a table with simulated data, as shown in example below:

```{r}
library(spm)
data <- simdata_cont(N=10)
head(data)
```



## Simulation strategies

R-package ```spm``` currently offers continuous- and discrete time simulations. Below we describe the simulations in details. In general, the input to each corresponding function: ```simdata_cont_MD(...)``` for continuous-time and ```simdata_discr_MD(...)``` for discrete-time simulations.

### Continuous-time simulation strategies

####Step 1
We model observations from a subject (which can be any system in general) and at first, we think that the subject is alive and compute the starting observation time ```t1``` and the next time ```t2```:

```t1 = runif(1, tstart, tend)```
```t2 = t1 + 2*runif(1, 0, 1)```

Here ```runif()``` a random number generator which returns uniformly distributed value. We assume that the ```t1``` as a random value, uniformly distributed from the start time (```tstart```) to end (```tend```). 

####Step 2

Computing y1 (an observed variable) from the previous observation:

```
if event = False:
  y1 = rnorm(1, ystart, sd0)
} else {
  y1 = y2
}
```

Here ```rnorm(...)``` is a random number generator which returns normally distributed values. 

####Step 3

In order to compute y2 , we need to compute a survival fuction ```S``` based on the equations 3, 4 and 5.
We then compare the ```S``` to the random number, uniformly distributed. 
If ```S``` is larger than that number, than we assume that the event is happened (death of subject or system failure). Otherwise we compute ```y2``` and proceed to the next iteration:

```
if S > runif(1, 0, 1) : 
    y2 = rnorm(1, m, sqrt(gamma))
    event = True
    new_subject = True
else if event = False:
  y2 = rnorm(1, m, sqrt(gamma))
  event = False
  new_record = True
```

###Discrete-time simulation strategies

In this case we use equal intervals ```dt``` between observations and survival function ```S``` is computed directly from $\mu$ (2):

$S = e^{-1\mu(t_1)}$

The rest of the discrete simulation routine is the same as in continuous-time simulation case.
